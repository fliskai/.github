# Flisk

Data quality is the foundation of every data-driven decision. But our existing tools fail to solve the issue, only providing bandaids and basic alerts. It's time to rethink data instrumentation to solve the issue at the source.

At Flisk, we're building a unified set of software and APIs for developers to collect data, for data teams to manage schemas, and for business teams to access that data in various destinations.

Stay tuned for more to come here soon!
